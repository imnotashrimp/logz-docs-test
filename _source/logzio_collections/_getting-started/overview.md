Welcome to the proof-of-concept for Logz.io Documentation Portal! You'll find examples of the different kinds of content I'll be using in the docs. And as a bonus, I used Shakespearean-Insult Ipsum.

Here's an overview of the main features of Logz.io.

<div class="info-box note"><p>This is a note. Notes are non-actionable bits of information that the user should know</p></div>

<p> </p>

<div class="info-box gotcha"><p>This is a "gotcha". It's a place to point out tricky things</p></div>

<p> </p>

<div class="info-box tip"><p>This is a tip. Here's where we'll place best practices and good actions to ensure success</p></div>

<p> </p>

<div class="info-box help"><p>This is a help box. We can redirect the user to resources that give them more information, like videos, blog entries, or other help articles. </p></div>

<p> </p>

<div class="info-box warning"><p>This is a warning. We'll use warnings when the user could cause damage that's difficult or impossible to recover from.</p></div>

## Shipping & parsing logs
There’s no more faith in thee than a stewed prune. Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbunkle in my corrupted blood. Away you three inch fool! Thou art a natural coward without instinct. You, minion, are too saucy. Thou art the best of cutthroats. A weasel has not such a spleen as you are toss’d with. Your virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese. Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth tongue, Spanish pouch. Thou art the son and heir of a mongrel.

## Alerting
You base football-player! You crooked-nose knave! You puterell, you skalemar. You hedge-born levereter, you bedswerver fopdoodle! Ye olde mucksprout and mumblecrust. You rakefile skobberlotcher. Thou subtle, perjur’d, false, disloyal man! Thou art like a toad; ugly and venomous. A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality. Thou are pigeon-liver’d and lack gall. Thine face is not worth sunburning. You are as a candle, the better burnt out.

## Insights
Thou accursed guts-griping promise-breaker! Thou clouted pox-marked canker-blossom! Thou appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. Thou clouted pox-marked canker-blossom! Thou slanderous clay-brained fustilarian! Thou wayward rough-hewn malt-horse! Thou dankish motley-minded bear-whelp! Thou withered bat-fowling imbossed carbunkle!

## API
Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul. Hast thou never an eye in thy head? Thou clouted crook-pated hugger-mugger! Thou dissembling idle-headed pigeon-egg! Thou mangled fen-sucked bum-bailey! Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish pouch! Thou rank hedge-born boar-pig! Thou wimpled clapper-clawed flax-wench! Thou qualling unwash'd devil-mon!
