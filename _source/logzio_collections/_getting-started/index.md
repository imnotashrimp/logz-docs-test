  There’s no more faith in thee than a stewed prune. Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbunkle in my corrupted blood. Away you three inch fool! Thou art a natural coward without instinct. You, minion, are too saucy. Thou art the best of cutthroats. A weasel has not such a spleen as you are toss’d with. Your virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese. Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth tongue, Spanish pouch. Thou art the son and heir of a mongrel bitch.

  Thou accursed guts-griping promise-breaker! Thou clouted pox-marked canker-blossom! Thou appeareth nothing to me but a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. Thou clouted pox-marked canker-blossom! Thou slanderous clay-brained fustilarian! Thou wayward rough-hewn malt-horse! Thou dankish motley-minded bear-whelp! Thou withered bat-fowling imbossed carbunkle!

  Thou surly doghearted bladder! Thou wimpled pox-marked whey-face! Thou qualling milk-livered measle! You are a tosser, wanker, git and mankey! A nutter, a lazy sod, a cream faced loon! Thou art as loathsome as a toad. Peace, ye fatguts! I do desire we may be better strangers.  Thou art a flesh-monger, fool and coward. You scullion, your rampillian, you fustilarian. I’ll tickle your catastrophe. Thou art as fat as butter.

  Thou clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou whoreson obscene greasy tallow-catch! That trunk of humours, that bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that grey Iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in years? You starvelling, you eel-skin, you dried neat’s-tongue, you bull’s-pizzle, you stock-fish–O for breath to utter what is like thee!-you tailor’s-yard, you sheath, you bow-case, you vile standing tuck!
