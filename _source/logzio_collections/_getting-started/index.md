You base football-player! You crooked-nose knave! You puterell, you skalemar. You hedge-born levereter, you bedswerver fopdoodle! Ye olde mucksprout and mumblecrust. You rakefile skobberlotcher. Thou subtle, perjur’d, false, disloyal man! Thou art like a toad; ugly and venomous. A most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise breaker, the owner of no one good quality. Thou are pigeon-liver’d and lack gall. Thine face is not worth sunburning. You are as a candle, the better burnt out.
