Thou misbegotten milk-livered bladder! You are as rheumatic as two dry toasts. Out of my sight! Thou dost infect my eyes. Thou fobbing unchin-snouted devil-mon! Thou cullionly spur-galled puttock! Thou pribbling rough-hewn horn-beast! Thou dankish onion-eyed clotpole! Thou dankish onion-eyed clotpole! Thou paunchy dread-bolted giglet! Thou currish common-kissing boar-pig! Thou churlish flap-mouthed fustilarian!
