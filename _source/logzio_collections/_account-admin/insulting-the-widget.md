Thou surly doghearted bladder! Thou wimpled pox-marked whey-face! Thou qualling milk-livered measle! You are a tosser, wanker, git and mankey! A nutter, a lazy sod, a cream faced loon!

## Head 2

Paragraph for head 2. Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul. Hast thou never an eye in thy head? Thou clouted crook-pated hugger-mugger! Thou dissembling idle-headed pigeon-egg! Thou mangled fen-sucked bum-bailey!

###### To insult the widget:

1. There’s no more faith in thee than a stewed prune.
2. Thou art a boil, a plague sore, an embossed carbunkle in my corrupted blood.
3. Away you three inch fool!
4. Thou art a natural coward without instinct.
    1. You, minion, are too saucy.
    2. Thou art the best of cutthroats.
    3. A weasel has not such a spleen as you are toss’d with.
5. Your virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese.
6. Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth tongue, Spanish pouch.
7. Thou art the son and heir of a mongrel bitch.


### Head 3

Paragraph for head 3. Thou leathern-jerkin, crystal-button, knot-pated, agatering, puke-stocking, caddis-garter, smooth-tongue, Spanish pouch! Thou rank hedge-born boar-pig! Thou wimpled clapper-clawed flax-wench! Thou qualling unwash'd devil-mon!
