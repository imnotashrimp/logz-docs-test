Thou surly doghearted bladder! Thou wimpled pox-marked whey-face! Thou qualling milk-livered measle! You are a tosser, wanker, git and mankey! A nutter, a lazy sod, a cream faced loon! Thou art as loathsome as a toad. Peace, ye fatguts! I do desire we may be better strangers.  Thou art a flesh-monger, fool and coward. You scullion, your rampillian, you fustilarian. Iâ€™ll tickle your catastrophe. Thou art as fat as butter.
