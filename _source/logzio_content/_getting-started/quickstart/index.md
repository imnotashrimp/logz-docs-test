## Ship sample logs

###### To ship sample Apache logs with Filebeat:
  1. First, get the file from [here](#)
  2. Then, install it in the right directory
      1. Some substeps may be involved
      2. It would be silly to have just one, so here's another.
  3. Then we'll need to resume the normal flow.
  4. If procedures get more complex than this, I'll look into some custom JavaScript, like [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
